# SQL-RockbusterProject

**INTRODUCTION**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services sucha as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

**KEY QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES**

The  Rockbuster  Stealth  Management  Board  has  asked  a  series  of  business  questions  and  they  expect  data-driven  answers  that  they  can  use  for  their  2020   company  strategy.  Here  are  the  main  questions  they’d  like  to  answer:  

● Which  movies  contributed  the  most/least  to  revenue  gain?  
● What  was  the  average  rental  duration  for  all  videos?    
● Which  countries  are  Rockbuster  customers  based  in?   
● Where  are  customers  with  a  high  lifetime  value  based?   
● Do  sales  figures  vary  between  geographic  regions?  

**CONTEXT**
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL (structured  query  language). Throughout this Achievement, you’ll learn SQL incrementally, and you’ll use it to answer increasingly complex business questions for  each task.  The  results  of  your  analysis  will  be  presented  to  Rockbuster  management,  so  you’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner. In other words, you’ll  build on what you’ve  learned  in  previous  Achievements.  

Although  you’ll  be  working  with  data  from  the  online  video  streaming  industry  for  this  project,  the  skills  you  develop  could  be  applied  to  any  industry  and  will  highlight  your  ability to  solve  problems  for  a  variety  of  clients.  The  aim  is  to  give  you  hands-on  experience  with  SQL.  By  the  time  you  finish  your  project,  you’ll  be  able  to  use  SQL  to  perform  various  kinds  of query-based  analyses. 

**DATA SET**
Data set contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory,  customers, and payments, among other things, loades into a PostgreSQL.
